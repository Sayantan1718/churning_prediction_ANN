This project focuses on predicting customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Customer churn, the act of customers leaving a business, can significantly impact revenue. By accurately predicting which customers are at risk of churning, businesses can proactively address the issue and retain valuable customers.

The Artificial Neural Network is built using Keras and TensorFlow. The model has the following structure:
    Input Layer: Accepts preprocessed customer data.
    Hidden Layers: Fully connected layers with ReLU activation.
    Output Layer: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification (Churn/No Churn).
